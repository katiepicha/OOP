'''
Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
- objects have both attributes and methods
    - attributes describe
    - methods perform operations and functions on attributes
- Data hiding: object's data attributes are hidden from code outside the object to protect from accidental corruption
    - some methods would not make sense/work for other attributes
    - public vs. private (accessible by user vs. by creator) methods
- Class: code that specifies the data attributes and methods of a particular type of object
    (similar to a blueprint of a house or a cookie cutter)
- Instance: an object created from a class
    (similar to a specific house built according to a blueprint)
    - there can be many instances of one class
- Class definition: set of statements that define a class's methods and data attributes
    - format: begin with class  class_name:
    (class names often start with uppercase letter)
